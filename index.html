        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I'm a fourth-year student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Business Economics, and I'm passionate about pursuing a career as a financial analyst in the sports industry. First and foremost, I consider myself a hardworking and goal-oriented individual. Throughout my academic journey, I have strived for excellence, which is reflected in my consistent presence on the honor roll and my cumulative GPA of 3.45. This determination to excel has been a driving force in my life, pushing me to constantly learn and grow. In addition to my academic achievements, I pride myself on being a team player. Whether it's in a classroom group project, on the soccer field, or in the workplace, I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. I find that the exchange of ideas and the synergy of a well-functioning team often lead to the most innovative solutions and successful outcomes.<br><br>

        My journey in the world of finance began with a remarkable opportunity to intern at a prominent $50 billion asset management company. During my time there, I gained invaluable insights into financial markets, investment strategies, and the intricate workings of the industry. This experience has ignited my passion for finance, and I'm eager to combine it with my love for sports to become a financial analyst in the sports sector. I currently hold a significant position at the University of California, Riverside, where I serve as a Supervisor in the Competitive Sports Program at the Student Recreation Center. This role has allowed me to develop leadership and organizational skills while overseeing various sports events and ensuring that our participants have a memorable and enjoyable experience. Beyond my studies and work experience, I've held various other positions, including being a shift lead at a local boba shop and a team member at a fast-casual dining restaurant. These roles have reinforced my understanding of customer service and operational efficiency.
<br><br>

        Aside from my professional and academic pursuits, I have a diverse set of interests. I have a particular fascination with accounting and management, which I believe will be instrumental in my future career as a financial analyst. I enjoy tackling critical thinking puzzles and indulging in board games, as they keep my mind sharp and always eager for new challenges. Staying active and healthy is also a priority in my life. I engage in various sports like soccer, golf, and basketball to maintain a balance between my academic and personal life. Sports have not only instilled discipline and teamwork in me but have also served as a stress-reliever and a source of great joy. On the language front, I am bilingual in English and Spanish, which I consider a valuable skill in our diverse and interconnected world. This proficiency allows me to communicate effectively and connect with a wider range of people. Lastly, I had the privilege of serving as the treasurer on the Red Cross Club board at my university, which allowed me to contribute to charitable causes and further develop my financial management skills. <br><br>
        
        In summary, I am a hardworking, goal-oriented individual with a passion for finance and a deep-rooted desire to excel in the sports industry. My academic achievements, coupled with my diverse interests and professional experience, make me a well-rounded candidate who is ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the world of finance in the sports sector.
